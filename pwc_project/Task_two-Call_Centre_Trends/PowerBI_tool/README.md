## What did I do?
* Removed the *Caller_ID* row
    * The information was not important for the task that needs to be done
  * Removed ***null*** values from all rows
     * This will help to organize data and avoid including any incomplete information in the visualization
## Reminder of goals
#### What does customer want answered?
* Claire is looking for insight
* Want overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior
* Clear visualizarion for important aspects and make them clear
   * Dashboard to be used as basis for discussion with management

#### What KPIs do I want to include?
* Overall customer satisfaction
    * This is represented as a ***pie chart***
* Satisfaction rate by topic
   * This is represented with a ***Donut chart***
   * Topics listed are color coded
   * Satisfaction rate is counted as a percentage

#### What does the KPIs tell me?
* Nearly every call is successfully resolved
* The main focus would most likely be on **Admin Support** and topics related to **Contract** to understand why these subjects may have a less satisfaction rate than the others

#### Based on the information, what are some possible solutions or suggestions?
