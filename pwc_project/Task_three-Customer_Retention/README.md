#### Background of task
* After presenting my dashboard to the customer, the Retention Manager reaches out to me directly
* They want to schedule a meeting with the engagement partner to cover thses points
    * Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don't want to lose them
    * The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
    * Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary
        * It would be better to know in advance who is at risk
    * We have done customer analysis with Excel
        * It has always ended in a dead-end
    *  We would like to know more about our customers
        * Visualised clearly so that it's self-explanatory for our management

  The Retention Manager has provided some information in the resources
        *
